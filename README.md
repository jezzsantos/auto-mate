# autoMate

At some point in every software project/product, you will have created patterns (between classes/objects/layers/systems) that you need to repeat over and over again to fit into your architecture (whether you think you have one or not).

At that essential point in time, you are going to wish you had some kind of helper that could _just_ apply your pattern for you 
throughout your codebase given just a few variables (names, options etc), 
and have it write the code for you the same way you would have written it. 
Only, infinity faster, and more reliably than you would have done!

That's what **autoMate** is. It is the **anti-rote software.**

autoMate learns your implementation patterns from you, and writes your code for you! 

## why autoMate?

Because, once you have designed software to work a certain way in your product/solution, and the design has stabalized, re-applying the design over and over again is tedious, boring and leads to inconsistencies and manual errors. No human wants to deal with.
Get out of copy/paste hell!

If only you could teach your tools to do that for you, and have it do the hard work of repeating the pattern, 
with just the right amount of variance to do it over again. 
Then you can then focus on evolving and optimizing the design as your product/solution evolves. 

Then, and this is the best part. Have the tool auto-refactor your existing code to upgrade that new design everywhere in your codebase!

We have been building these kinds of developer tools for the last decade, 
and now we want to broaden it applicability to all kinds of platforms, languages and projects.
We understand that expensive tools, IDE's, licenses, platforms, 
language choices etc just get in the way of developers doing the right thing, 
so we are going to focus instead on you the developer gaining this capability in the work you do no matter who you do it for. 
Whether that is for a corporate business, startup, or as a contractor, open source contributor 
you can choose to use tools like autoMate to write the software for you.

Our goal, at autoMate, it to revolutionize the way quality software is built and maintained long-term, 
so that you can focus on getting software systems working and optimized just the way you like them implemented.

Dont be a code monkey! Add autoMate to your tool-chain and get more productive as a software craftsman.
